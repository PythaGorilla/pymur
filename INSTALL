Prerequisites:
 * Python (http://python.org) >= 2.4 (as well as the Python header files)
 * Lemur (http://www.lemurproject.org)
 * Until there is a stable release, you will need the autotools as well (autoconf, automake, libtool) 

Currently, when you make install Lemur a static library is installed. Pymur requires a dynamic library 
for a number of reasons. Until Lemur ships with this option, you will need to first run a script to 
create the dynamic library: 

$> sudo ./make_shared_lemur.sh

This should not affect any programs that link to lemur. At this point you can build and install pymur: 

$> sh autogen.sh 
$> make
$> sudo make install

Then, if you'd like:
$> make docs
$> make test

See https://projects.dbbe.musc.edu/trac/pymur for more information.
