Prerequisites:
 * Python (http://python.org) >= 2.4 (as well as the Python header files)
 * Lemur (http://www.lemurproject.org)

Currently, when you make install Lemur a static library is installed. Pymur can use either that static
library, or, if you'd like, a dynamic library (this option is best if you intend on ever upgrading
Lemur - so you don't have to recompile pymur).  This is not necessary, but recommended.

To create a dynamic library:
$> sudo ./make_shared_lemur.sh

This should not affect any programs that were compiled with lemur. At this point you can build and install pymur: 
$> sh autogen.sh 
$> make
$> sudo make install

Then, if you'd like:
$> make docs
$> make test

See http://findingscience.com/pymur for more information.
